### Platform Design in Curated Dating Markets

<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>Motivated by online dating apps, we consider the problem of selecting the subset of profiles to show to each user in each period in a two-sided matching platform. Users on each side observe the profiles set by the platform and decide which of them to like. A match occurs if and only if two users mutually like each other, potentially in different periods. We study how platforms should make this decision to maximize the expected number of matches under different platform designs, varying (i) how users interact with each other, i.e., whether one or both sides of the market can initiate an interaction (one and two-directional, resp.), and (ii) the timing of matches, i.e., whether the platform allows non-sequential matches (i.e., when both users see and like each other in the same period) in addition to sequential ones. We focus on the case with two periods and study the performance of different approaches.</p>

### College Application Mistakes and the Design of Information Policies at Scale
{: .paper-title}
with [T. Larroucau](https://tlarroucau.github.io/) and [C. Neilson](https://christopherneilson.github.io)  
**Minor Revision at Journal of Political Economy** | [PDF]({{ site.baseurl }}/Papers/Information_Policies_at_Scale_LRFN_2024.pdf)
{: .paper-info}

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>In this paper, we present the results of a multi-year collaboration with policy-makers to design and evaluate whether information policies implemented at scale can effectively improve students' outcomes. Using a series of nationwide surveys, we find that ~40% of students do not apply to their preferred college and major, and 10% of these students would have strictly benefited by including these programs. Upon these results, we implemented with the Ministry of Education of Chile a large-scale field experiment for college admissions, which included personalized information about program characteristics, students' admission probabilities, and alternative major recommendations. The intervention significantly reduced application mistakes, increasing the probability of assignment for unmatched students by 20% and the probability of improving the assignment of undermatched students by 38%. After scaling-up the policy, the intervention approximately doubled the matching probability for unmatched and undermatched students and tripled the enrollment likelihood for initially unmatched students.</p>

### Dynamic College Admissions

with [T. Larroucau](https://tlarroucau.github.io/)  
**Resubmitted to Econometrica** | [PDF]({{ site.baseurl }}/Papers/tomas_jmp.pdf)
{: .paper-info}

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>We analyze the relevance of incorporating dynamic incentives and eliciting private information about students' preferences to improve their welfare and outcomes in dynamic centralized assignment systems. We show that the most common assignment mechanism, the Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm, can result in significant inefficiencies as it fails to elicit cardinal information on students' preferences. We collect novel data about students' preferences, their beliefs on admission chances, and their college outcomes for the Chilean college system. We analyze two main behavioral channels that explain students' dynamic decisions.</p>

### Stable Matching with Contingent Priorities
{: .paper-title}
with [F. Bobbio](https://cerc-datascience.polymtl.ca/person/federico-bobbio/), [M. Carvalho](http://margaridacarvalho.org), and [A. Torrico](https://sites.google.com/view/atorrico)  
**Submitted to Management Science** | [PDF]({{ site.baseurl }}/Papers/Dynamic_preferences.pdf)
{: .paper-info}

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>We study stable matching problems under contingent priorities, whereby the clearinghouse prioritizes some agents based on the allocation of others. Using school choice as a motivating example, we first introduce a stylized model of a many-to-one matching market where the clearinghouse aims to prioritize applicants with siblings assigned to the same school and match them together. We provide a series of guidelines to implement these contingent priorities and introduce two novel concepts of stability that account for them.</p>

<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>Charitable donations are a vital source of funding for non-profit organizations, enabling them to carry out their mission of addressing social issues and providing support to those in need. To enhance donations, fundraisers employ various designs aimed at increasing donations. This paper investigates the effectiveness of two design choices in the context of fundraising: (i) matching and (ii) gift unlock. We find that given a fixed fundraising budget, the gift unlock design consistently leads to higher overall contributions.</p>

### Team Building and Incentive Schemes in Collaborative Projects
{: .paper-title}
with [R. Beer](https://www.ruthybeer.com/) and [A. Qi](https://sites.google.com/site/anyanqioperations/)  
**Submitted to M&SOM**
{: .paper-info}

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>We study the effects of incentive schemes and their interaction with team-building activities to reduce project delays. We introduce a stylized model of a project involving two sequential tasks performed by two workers, each responsible for one task. We show that workers will complete their tasks as soon as possible provided a large enough penalty, regardless of the incentives scheme. We hypothesize that behavioral drivers like social preferences and strategic uncertainty may create distinctions among incentive schemes, potentially amplified by team-building activities fostering team identity and cooperation.</p>

### Admission Policies with Exam Retakes: Efficiency–Equity Trade-offs in Multidimensional Scoring
{: .paper-title}
with R. Sharma
{: .paper-info}

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>Admission systems worldwide increasingly allow students to take standardized entrance exams multiple times, yet institutions differ sharply in how they aggregate scores across attempts. These retake and aggregation policies shape students' incentives, influence who chooses to retake, and ultimately affect both the efficiency and equity of admissions. Using administrative data from the Chilean centralized admissions system, we document substantial heterogeneity in retaking behavior across socioeconomic groups and show that retaking is strongly associated with improved admission outcomes.</p>

### From One Solution to Another: Optimality-Based Counterfactuals in Resource Allocation Problems
{: .paper-title}
with J. Chua and [I. Zhu](https://www.ianyzhu.com/)
{: .paper-info}

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>Optimization models are increasingly used to support high-stakes resource-allocation decisions, yet the solutions they produce often face scrutiny from stakeholders who seek to understand realized outcomes or evaluate alternative allocations. We develop a unified framework for optimality-based counterfactual analysis that quantifies the smallest adjustments to an optimization model's objective coefficients under which a different allocation—satisfying user-specified conditions—would become optimal.</p>

### Strategic Behavior in the Chilean College Admissions Problem
{: .paper-title}
with [T. Larroucau](https://tlarroucau.github.io/) | [PDF]({{ site.baseurl }}/Papers/strategic_behavior_college.pdf)
{: .paper-info}

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>We analyze the application process in the Chilean College Admissions problem. Students can submit up to 10 preferences, but most of the students do not fill their entire application list ("short-list"). Even though students face no incentives to misreport, we find evidence of strategic behavior as students tend to omit programs if their admission probabilities are too low.</p>

### Optimal Design of Search Platforms: Behavioral Insights
{: .paper-title}

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>We explore how the search environment influences users' search behavior and outcomes. Motivated by dating and home-servicing platforms, we focus on the effect of (i) the search mechanism, i.e., whether users evaluate options sequentially or simultaneously; (ii) the number of options available, capturing scenarios of abundance and scarcity; and (iii) the search cost that agents incur for each option they evaluate.</p>

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>Assignment mechanisms for many-to-one matching markets with preferences revolve around the key concept of stability. Using school choice as our matching market application, we introduce the problem of jointly allocating a school capacity expansion and finding the best stable allocation for the students in the expanded market. We theoretically analyze the problem, focusing on the trade-off behind the multiplicity of student-optimal assignments, the incentive properties, and the problem's complexity.</p>
