## Education

My research in education focuses on matching mechanisms and school choice systems. I study the design and implementation of centralized assignment mechanisms that improve student outcomes while maintaining fairness and stability. Key areas include:

- **School choice mechanisms**: Designing efficient and fair algorithms for assigning students to schools
- **College admissions**: Analyzing strategic behavior and information provision in college admissions systems
- **Capacity planning**: Optimizing school capacity decisions in the presence of assignment mechanisms
- **Policy evaluation**: Assessing the real-world impact of assignment reforms in Chile and other countries

This work combines theoretical mechanism design with large-scale empirical analysis and field implementations, directly informing education policy.

## Platforms

I investigate how platforms can be designed to improve market outcomes for all participants. My research examines the role of information, algorithms, and interface design in two-sided markets:

- **Dating platforms**: Studying how platform design choices affect matching quality and user satisfaction
- **Two-sided markets**: Analyzing competition and strategic behavior in online marketplaces
- **Algorithm transparency**: Understanding how revealing algorithmic details impacts user trust and behavior
- **Platform governance**: Examining how platforms can balance efficiency with fairness considerations

This research has implications for the design of major online platforms including dating apps, ride-sharing services, and labor marketplaces.

## Behavioral Operations

My work in behavioral operations combines experimental methods with operational modeling to understand human decision-making in operational contexts:

- **Process automation**: Studying behavioral responses to automation and human-machine collaboration
- **Strategic behavior**: Analyzing how individuals respond to incentives in matching markets
- **Decision support systems**: Designing tools that help people make better operational decisions
- **Learning and adaptation**: Understanding how workers learn and adapt in complex operational environments

This research uses laboratory experiments, field experiments, and structural estimation to provide insights for improving operational systems that involve human decision-makers.
