Thrilled to announce that our paper "[The Dating Heuristic: A Provably Strong Matching Algorithm for Dating Platforms](/assets/pdf/provable_guarantees_full.pdf)" has been accepted at _Manufacturing & Service Operations Management (M&SOM)_! This work, co-authored with [Alfredo Torrico](https://sites.google.com/view/atorrico), develops provably strong algorithms for matching in online dating platforms. I'm deeply grateful to Alfredo for being such a great co-author, and to the editorial team and reviewers at M&SOM for their thoughtful feedback that greatly improved the paper.
